            "question": "Why is one side of my titanium knife rough?",
            "answer": "Titanium doesn’t hold an edge on its own, so each Ti knife is carbidized with tungsten carbide on one side. This creates micro-serrations that cut cleanly through soft materials like meat, cardboard, or rope.\nThe carbided layer is deep and durable thanks to our industrial process.\n\nTips:\n•\tTi edges perform best with draw cuts\n•\tThey’re not ideal for cutting hide\n•\tOnly sharpen the non-carbided side\n\nWe’re slowly moving away from titanium blades due to low demand, but we’ll continue sharpening and servicing all previous models.",

            "question": "Doesn’t the paracord handle just get dirty?",
            "answer": "Yes, but that’s part of its charm. Paracord is easy to replace. It’s not meant to be permanent think of it as a modular grip that can be swapped out in minutes. Not sure how to wrap? Add the Knife Sharpening product to your cart and check it, its covered.",
