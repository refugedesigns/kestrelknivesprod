I live in northern BC, Fort Nelson, a couple hours’ drive and 5 of our horses. 20 km trip into base camp, and day rides from there. 9 days on horses, 180+ km between boots and horseback. On the 7th day I shot my ram.The knife was amazing. My dad had his Havalon and I had my Kestrel. His Havalon handle snapped on him, and we finished the caping with my Kestrel",

I've used many brands of knives and Kestrel Knives are the only one I've found that can hold a sharp edge the longest. I bought my first EDC about 3 years ago and skinned 2 elk and a 1,200 lbs buffalo with it so far and still haven't had to use my wet stone to resharpen it.",

It does take some getting used to but once you understand how the knife works it cuts like butter and stays sharp... I only touched up the knife once with a field sharpening kit from Nathan after three animals and only because I wanted to try the sharpening kit. To my surprise I worked well fleshing out hides as well as cutting through meat.I use this knife all the time now, from cutting rope, meat, hides, vegetables, cardboard and whatever else happens to need severing.This is a great knife that's extremely light and stays sharp and will stay on my pack on all my future hunts.",

The replaceable blade design keeps it razor sharp when I need it most, and the lightweight build makes it a must have that earned its place in my pack. It's tough, reliable and purpose built for the mountain. This knife is made for serious hunters.",

It’s so light and thin you don’t even know it’s in your pack. The other thing I really like is that it’s so simple…no folding mechanism or blades to cut yourself on while changing them out (Havalon!) but enough mass behind the blade to really carve against bone, pry with, or whatever. Kestrel has it figured out…simple, effective, light, and cutting edge (pun intended)",

After he sent me a titanium ultra light knife to look at, I immediately ordered several of them. I used it on a recent Stone sheep hunt in BC and it was wonderful and unbelievably lightweight. It retained its edge through the dressing and full body caping and is still sharp enough for several more. I had taken a couple of other kestrels with me and gave them to my guide and wrangler. They loved the feel and weight and the way the knife kept its edge.I've since ordered several more and will be passing them out around the world. Thanks Nate for a great knife and great customer interaction!!!!",

It holds an edge and sharpens easily, it’s bombproof, and it fits so well in my hand even when it’s covered in blood, dirt, and guts. It’s been with me on all my elk, deer, bear, and moose hunts all over North America and even on fishing trips. It’s gutted, skinned, butchered, deboned, and quartered many animals and has been my general go-to knife for life in the backcountry.",
